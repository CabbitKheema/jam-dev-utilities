          This free image resizer is a versatile tool that allows you to resize
          various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and SVG. While PNG and
          JPEG images are raster-based and can have their dimensions adjusted,
          SVGs are vector-based and can be scaled infinitely without losing
          quality. Whether you need to reduce file size, adjust dimensions, or
          convert formats, our tool can help. Made with ðŸ’œ by the developers
          building Jam.

        <h2>Benefits of Using an Image Resizer</h2>
        <p>
          Resizing images helps in optimizing their use across different
          platforms and devices. Whether you're a developer, designer, or
          content creator, resizing images can greatly enhance the performance
          and aesthetics of your work.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Performance:</b> <br /> Smaller image files load faster,
            improving website performance and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compatibility:</b> <br /> Ensure your images fit perfectly on
            different screens and devices by adjusting their dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>File Size Reduction:</b> <br /> Reducing the dimensions can
            significantly decrease the file size without losing quality. This is
            particularly effective with PNG and JPEG formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>SVG Scalability:</b> <br /> SVG images are vector-based, meaning
            they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. Our tool
            allows you to resize SVGs for different contexts or convert them to
            PNG/JPEG if needed.

          <li>
            <b>How does the image resizer maintain quality?</b> <br /> Our tool
            uses advanced algorithms to resize images while preserving their
            original quality, ensuring sharpness and clarity. For SVGs, the tool
            ensures that the vector quality is maintained at any size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What formats are supported?</b> <br /> Currently, our tool

          <li>
            <b>Can I resize images to specific dimensions?</b> <br /> Yes, you
            can specify either the width or height, and the aspect ratio will be

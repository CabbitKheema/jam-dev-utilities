# Contributing Guidelines

Many of these tools are built on the back of open-source libraries & frameworks. We're excited to add more! Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated (and rewarded with pizza).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name, such as `feature/feature-name`.
4. Using Prettier and ESLint is necessary. Make sure that your code is properly formatted and follows our coding style guidelines. You can format your code by running `npm run format` and lint your code by running `npm run lint`.
5. Write tests to cover your changes and ensure they pass by running `npm run test`.
6. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message. Follow good Git commit message practices, such as using prefixes like `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `test`, etc.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your forked repository.
2. Go to the original repository and create a new pull request.
3. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the pull request.
4. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by the project maintainers.
5. Address any feedback or comments given during the review process.
6. Ensure that all automatic CI checks pass. These checks include formatting with Prettier, linting with ESLint, building the project, and running tests.
7. Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

## Deployment

Our project is hosted on Cloudflare pages. Once your changes are merged, they will be deployed to our production environment.

Thank you for your contributions!

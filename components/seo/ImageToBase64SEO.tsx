          Converting an image to base64 lets you insert binary data into web
          pages. This treats the data as external resources.

        <p>
          Converting an image to base64 changes the image data. You can include
          this format directly in your code. You can even use the img src
          attribute with base64-encoded data.

          overall performance.

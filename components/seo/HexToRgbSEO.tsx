        <h2>Understanding RGB HEX Conversion for Web</h2>
        <p>
          Color conversions between HEX and RGB are essential for web developers
          and designers working with CSS. HEX color codes, also known as
          hexadecimal color codes, use hexadecimal numbers to define colors in
          HTML and CSS with a six-digit format, such as #000000 for black. RGB
          (Red, Green, Blue) color codes use a combination of red, green, and
          blue values ranging from 0 to 255 to create a color. In this case,
          black would be: rgb(0, 0, 0).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converting between HEX and RGB is crucial for accurately matching
          colors across different design tools and coding environments.

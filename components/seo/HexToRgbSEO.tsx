        <h2>Understanding RGB HEX Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          Color conversions between HEX and RGB are essential for web developers
          and designers working with CSS. HEX color codes, also known as
          hexadecimal color codes, use hexadecimal numbers to define colors in
          HTML and CSS with a six-digit format, such as #000000 for black. RGB
          (Red, Green, Blue) color codes use a combination of red, green, and
          blue values ranging from 0 to 255 to create a color. In this case,
          black would be: rgb(0, 0, 0).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converting from HEX to RGB is crucial for accurately matching colors
          across different design tools and coding environments.
